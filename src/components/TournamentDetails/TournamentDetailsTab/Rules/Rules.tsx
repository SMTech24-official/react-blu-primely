If game rules are incorrect, either the hosting or non-hosting team should take a screenshot and attempt to correct the issue due to these bugs. Games will not be issuing forfeits or replays, as this is a common issue. All rounds played before leaving will be counted if neither team leaves and both teams decide to play on. In the results will also show. We recommend that you check if there are mistakes at the start of round 1 and leave immediately if so. Please note that if you leave after round 1 has been played, those rounds will count towards the final score regardless of settings being incorrect."
